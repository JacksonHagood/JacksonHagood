                        Digital solution to any student's flashcard needs. Allows users to upload pictures of their
                        handwritten notes and obtain digitally manageable flashcards. CardMe allows the user to groups these
                        flashcards into folders, edit flashcards, delete flashcards, add flashcards, and delete folders.
                        CardMe also allows users to easily find YouTube videos related to their flashcards. Finally, CardMe
                        can export a folder of flashcards as a PDF that, when printed double sided, can be cut out into
                        flashcards. Final project for CSCE 315.

                        can be recorded by any phone or audio recorder. Audio files can be then decrypted by another
                        instance of the device with the same DIP switch configuration. Final project for CSCE 462.
