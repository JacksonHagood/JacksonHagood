                <p>
                    In 2014 I started my first major modern creative world, Villa Savoye. In this world I was able to
                    explore contemporary design in Minecraft and formulate my own identity. In 2016 I began work on its
                    sequel, Villa Savoye II, which I am working on to this day. Villa Savoye II is my largest single
                    effort in Minecraft, with over 500 hours in the world. Villa Savoye II now has hundreds of houses, a
                    city, and many secrets.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In order to allow for unhindered creativity, I created my own resource pack by combining several
                    others. The result is mostly composed of textures from Flows HD, UTB, and Cubed. I created the world
                    with mods and tools like World Painter, World Edit, and Single Player Commands. I decided to stop
                    updating the world after 1.12.2 as newer versions would present issues with the resource pack and
                    performance (and because the world would not significantly benefit from any new features). The world
                    is best viewed in Optifine with Sildurs Vibrant shaders and the resource pack is a requirement.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have decided to not post the world for download until it is completed. Currently, I plan to call
                    the world "complete" on the 10-year anniversary, though this might change. Honestly, I may never
                    call the world complete.

                    <p>
                        My most regent major project in Villa Savoye II was Palette Island. The island consists of 12
                        houses, 9 skyscrapers, 3 farms, and several parks. The island is built around a large nature preserve
                        in the center with all buildings along the coast. On side of the island consists of the majority of
                        the houses in a single row. The opposite side is where the city is located. On the smaller ends
                        there are farms and the rest of the houses. I am currently working on the neighboring island.

                        In my first five years in Villa Savoye II I have created hundreds of houses and constucted several
                        skyscrapers in 8 major areas. I am extremely proud of the result and have come a long way since my
                        first houses. To commemorate this anniversary I have created a monument to 5 years. Here is to 5
                        more.
