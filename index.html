                    <p>
                        This May I graduated with a degree in Computer Engineering from Texas A&M University with a 4.0 GPA.
                        I will forever treasure my time as a student and teaching assistant at Texas A&M. In the last four
                        years I have developed a love and appreciation for computer science and mathematics that I hope to
                        pass on to others. This August I will be rejoining JPMorgan Chase & Co. as a Software Engineer (SEP)
                        in Plano, TX.
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>
                        Most experience with C++, Java, and Python. I have developed front-end applications in JavaScript
                        with React, Redux, and Material UI. Back-end experience in Spring Boot and Flask. Throughout my
                        studies and personal projects I have explored programming language theory, with languages like
                        Haskell, and low level programming in ARM assembly language. I have great interest in mathematics,
                        including topics in number theory and cryptography.
                    </p>

                        This website serves as a place to host my qualifications and resume along with my projects and
                        personal interests. Education is a life long endeavor and I seek to never stop learning and giving
                        back to the world.
                    </p>
